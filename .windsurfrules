### **Suggested Tech Stack**

Recommendations:
- **Frontend Framework:** Vue 3(JS) with Vuetify.
- **Backend:** NONE
- **UI Library:** Tailwind V4 with custom CSS
- **State Management:** Pinia (Vueâ€™s modern state management library).

RULES TO FOLLOW:
  - Always make sure everything is maintainable, readable, and scalable.
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid), and YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it).
  - Read fully upto 200 each file when you read file for analysis(understand the concept fully)

TAILWIND V4 UPDATE APPROACH:
  - Tailwind V4 setup is correct and follows upated approach, therefore don't touch that!
  - Tailwind v4 is now CSS based approach, and all js related files are deleted and now it relies on lightning CSS no tailwind.config.js at all.
  - Donot use `@apply` directive, instead use utility classes directly in your CSS. (NEVER USE @apply)

**Vue 3 compatibility issues:**
- Setup Doesn't need explicit `export default`, Leads to <script setup> cannot contain ES module exports. If you are using a previous version of <script setup>
